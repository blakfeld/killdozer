# RC Tractor IRC Controller

This is a somewhat goofy project to control a physical RC Bulldozer using a Raspberry Pi and some relays. Naturally, this code isn't super useful without the physical component, but it does stand as a good example of how to use the GPIO pins on your Raspberry Pi and how to create an IRC/Twitch Bot.
